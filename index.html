                <h2>Summary</h2>
                I am currently employed as a technical support analyst where I have gained valuable hands on experience using a ticketing system and providing technical support to customers who have been techical users and non technical.The support I provide to the customers is both hardware and support. Prior to this role, I had a successful career in the retail industry, starting from an entry-level position and steadily progressing to a managerial role. Over the years, I have dedicated my personal time to enhance my knowledge and skills in various IT-related areas. I have actively pursued self-directed learning by completing numerous courses that cover a wide range of technology disciplines.

My background in retail has instilled in me a strong work ethic, exceptional customer service skills, and the ability to thrive in a fast-paced and dynamic environment. These transferable skills, combined with my self-motivation and dedication to continuous learning, equip me with a solid foundation for success in the tech industry.

I am eager to apply my existing strengths and newfound IT knowledge to a new career path within the tech industry. I am open to opportunities that allow me to contribute to the growth and innovation of a forward-thinking organization. With my adaptable nature and willingness to embrace new challenges, I am confident in my ability to make a positive impact and quickly adapt to the rapidly evolving tech landscape.

I look forward to utilizing my diverse background and passion for technology to contribute to the success of a tech-focused company, while also continuing to expand my skills and knowledge in this exciting field.
